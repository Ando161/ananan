    Genshin Impact is an open-world action role-playing game that allows the player to control one of four interchangeable characters in a party. Switching between characters can be done quickly during combat, allowing the player to use several different combinations of skills and attacks. Characters may have their strengths enhanced in various ways, such as increasing a character's level and improving artifacts and the weapons that the character equips. In addition to exploration, the player can attempt various challenges for rewards. Scattered across Teyvat are bosses and challenges that reward highly valuable resources, such as Stormterror and the Electro Hypostasis, but claiming them uses up a currency called resin, which slowly regenerates over time.[5] Completing these challenges grants the player progress towards increasing their Adventure Rank, which in turn unlocks new quests, challenges, and raises the World Level.[6] The World Level is a measure of how strong the enemies within the world are and the rarity of rewards that defeating them gives.

The player can control their character and perform actions such as running, climbing, swimming, and gliding which are limited by stamina. Some characters possess abilities that can
 alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an ice path that can aid the player in traversing terrain. Many teleportation nodes exist throughout the world that players 
 can warp to as a form of fast travel; among these are landmarks known as Statues of The Seven that 
can heal and revive characters, and provide benefits such as increasing player stamina. Items such as food and ore may be procured from the open world
 while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that may be used in enhancing a character's strength. Players can obtain food from hunting animals, gathering 
 fruit and vegetables, or purchasing them from a store. Ingredients that can be cooked into meals that regenerate characters' health or boost various stats. Players can also procure
  ore that can be refined and then used to create weapons or enhance their strength
Each character has two unique combat skills: an Elemental Skill and an Elemental Burst. The Elemental Skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after
 use. In contrast, the Elemental Burst has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient elemental energy by defeating enemies or inflicting elemental status effects.
  Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo, Electro and Geo; which correspond to ice, grass, fire, water, wind, thunder, and
   rock respectively. These elements can interact in 
 different ways; for example, if a Hydro attack hits a target, the enemy will be inflicted with the "Wet" status effect, and if they are hit with a Cryo attack, it will inflict 
 "Cryo". These two status effects combine into the "Frozen" status effect, temporarily preventing the target from performing any actions or until the player deals enough physical 
 damage to the enemy. Switching between characters during combat and executing those skills allows those elemental interactions to take place.[16] Certain elemental abilities may
  be required to solve puzzles within the overworld.


A multiplayer mode is available in the form of co-op. Up to 4 players can play together in the overworld and join Domains. Player matching can either be done by requesting to
 connect with another player.[17] If the player wishes to clear a Domain with other players, they will be automatically matched up with others looking to tackle the same objective.
 The game features cross-platform play, so players on any platform can play with each other.

By completing quests to advance the story, the player can initially unlock four additional playable characters, and more characters can be obtained via a gacha mechanic and 
in-game events. Several premium in-game currencies, obtainable through in-app purchases and playing the game, can be used to obtain characters and weapons through the
 gacha system. A pity system guarantees that the player will receive rare items after a set number of draws.

<p class="q1">
    Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, and is composed of seven major nations being Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and 
    Snezhnaya; each nation is ruled by a different god . The mysterious floating island of Celestia is allegedly home to gods and mortals who have ascended to
     godhood through great, heroic feats.[‡ 2] Underground lie the ruins of the nation of Khaenri'ah which was destroyed by gods 500 years before the events of the game.
      Unlike the seven major nations, Khaenri'ah was not ruled over by a god. The player character, the Traveler (male or female depending on the player's choice), is separated 
      from their twin and becomes trapped in Teyvat. They are joined by a companion, Paimon, as they journey through Teyvat in search of their lost sibling. The male Traveler is 
      named Aether (known as Kong in Chinese and Sora in Japanese), and the female Traveler is named Lumine (known as Ying in Chinese and Hotaru in Japanese). Although players can 
      choose the name they want to be referred by, the Traveler's sibling (whichever twin not chosen at the start of the game) refers to the Traveler by either Aether or Lumine 
      (depending on the gender of the player's chosen twin), regardless of their custom name.

Each nation is associated with and worships one of The Seven, a group of gods known as the "Archons", who each preside over one of the seven nations.
Each member of The Seven is tied to one of the game's elements, and is also reflected in their nation's aspect. Barbatos, Rex Lapis, the Raiden Shogun and the Tsaritsa are the 
Archons of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma and Snezhnaya, respectively.[‡ 5] However, the god who is the Archon may change over time as Archons pass away. Specific 
individuals chosen by the Archons are granted a Vision—magical gemstones that give their bearers the ability to command an element and the potential to ascend to godhood and reside
 in Celestia.

Mondstadt, the city of freedom, worships the Anemo Archon Barbatos and sits on an island in the middle of a lake. The city is protected by the Knights of Favonius, who are tasked 
with protecting Mondstadt and its citizens. To the southwest, Liyue worships the Geo Archon Rex Lapis (also known as Morax) and is the largest market harbor in Teyvat. The
 harbor city is presided over by the Liyue Qixing, a group of business leaders, and ancient guardians known as Adepti, a class of magical beings that includes Rex Lapis himself. 
 Across the sea to the southeast lies the isolationist island nation of Inazuma, overseen by the authoritarian regime of the Raiden Shogun (also known as Baal) and three governmental
  bodies that together make up the Tri-Commission: the Tenryou Commission, Kanjou Commission, and Yashiro Commission; overseeing military and executive affairs,[‡ 14] finances
   and foreign affairs,[‡ 15] and ceremonial affairs respectively.


Snezhnaya, ruled by the Cryo Archon known as the Tsaritsa, sends out diplomats named the Fatui who maintain a friendly appearance while using more underhanded methods secretly. 
The Fatui are also led by the Eleven Harbingers, individuals given extraordinary powers and executive authority by the Tsaritsa.[‡ 18] Among them include "The Balladeer" 
Scaramouche, "The Fair Lady" La Signora, and Tartaglia ("Childe"); who are respectively the sixth, eighth, and eleventh of the Eleven Harbingers. In addition to the Fatui, 
another antagonistic faction in the game is the Abyss Order, a legion of monsters that declares themselves to be enemies to all of humanity. They are led by the "Prince" or 
"Princess", the lost sibling of the Traveler

<p class="e1">
    A pair of twins who travel across the stars and visit 
    different worlds arrive in the land of Teyvat, but find that 
    the nation of Khaenri'ah is under cataclysmic siege. Attempting
     to leave to avoid the carnage, the twins are separated by an
      unknown god, who takes one and seals away the other. Five hundred
       years later, the sealed twin, referred to as the "Traveler",
        awakens and meets Paimon. The pair travel to nearby Mondstadt 
        to start their search for the Traveler's missing twin.


The duo arrive in the city of Mondstadt, and encounter 
a dragon named Stormterror which attacks the city. Aided by an 
unknown entity, the Traveler fends off Stormterror and is recognized
 by Jean, acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. The Traveler
  helps the Knights restore order to the region, and then meets Venti,
   a local bard who comes up with a plan to stop Stormterror, whose true name is Dvalin. Venti requests for them to retrieve a holy lyre so that he may play it to Dvalin, calming him. After retrieving the lyre, which was first stolen by members of a mysterious organization called the Fatui, Venti attempts to calm Dvalin but realizes that the dragon is being manipulated by the Abyss Order, an organization of nonhuman beings who are the enemies of humanity and surface civilization. Venti's true identity is revealed: he is secretly Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, and was also the one who guided the Traveler during their fight with Dvalin. The Traveler, accompanied by Jean, Diluc and Venti, pursue Dvalin to his domain and free him from the Abyss Order's influence. Returning to Mondstadt, Venti is ambushed by Fatui Harbinger La Signora, who steals his Gnosis, the symbol of his power as an Archon.

Venti advises the Traveler to travel to Liyue next to meet Rex Lapis, 
the Geo Archon. However, when the Traveler arrives during the annual
 Rite of Descension ritual, Rex Lapis is apparently killed, and his 
 body hidden. The Traveler meets Fatui Harbinger Childe, who is secretly searching for Rex Lapis' Gnosis. Childe manipulates the Traveler to destabilize Liyue by relaying the news of Rex Lapis' death to the Adepti, the immortal guardians of Liyue, who lose faith in the Qixing, the organization of trade heads who administer Liyue Harbor. While working with Zhongli, a funeral parlor consultant who is overseeing Rex Lapis' funeral, Childe discovers the location of Rex Lapis' body, which had been hidden away. The Traveler confronts Childe who attempts to take the Gnosis but is unable to find it, concluding that Rex Lapis is still alive. To lure out Rex Lapis, Childe summons Osial, an ancient god once defeated by Rex Lapis, but the combined forces of the Traveler, the Liyue Qixing and the Adepti defeat it, albeit at the cost of the Qixing's prized Jade Chamber. Afterwards, Traveler discovers that Zhongli is the human vessel of Rex Lapis, who gives his Gnosis to Signora as part of a discreet contract with the Tsaritsa, the Cryo Archon and leader of the Fatui. Zhongli explains he faked his death as he wished to step down from his role as Archon, and that their defense of 
Liyue proved that they did not need his protection.

<p class="e2">
    Before moving on to their next destination, the Traveler meets a mysterious individual named Dainsleif, and together they investigate a plot by the Abyss Order to create an artificial god to topple Celestia. While investigating, the Traveler reunites with their sibling, discovering that they have become the leader of the Abyss Order. The sibling reveals that Dainsleif was a guard of Khaenri'ah, and failed its people when the nation fell 500 years ago. Remarking that the Traveler will come to understand the true nature of the world at the end of their journey, the sibling departs, and Dainsleif chases after them. The Traveler attempts to follow but is unable to, and resolves to continue their journey.

The Traveler decides that their next destination will be Inazuma; however, because of the Sakoku Decree, the nation has closed off its borders under order of the Electro Archon, the Raiden Shogun, so they find a ship captain, Beidou, who grants them passage to Inazuma after winning her tournament. The Raiden Shogun has decreed that all Visions are to be confiscated under her Vision Hunt Decree, and due to their assistance of a vision holder, the Traveler has a bounty placed on their head. This leads them to seek asylum with Watatsumi Island's resistance army led by Sangonomiya Kokomi, helping them fight the Shogun's army. There, the Traveler discovers that the Fatui were behind the decree and raids a Fatui facility in response, but they are ultimately defeated by the Fatui Harbinger Scaramouche. Yae Miko gives him the Electro Gnosis, saving the Traveler. She brings them to the shrine, where she reveals she used to be close friends with the Electro Archon and teaches the Traveler how to fight her. She also reveals that there are three "Raiden Shoguns": the first Electro Archon, Makoto, died 500 years ago; her twin and kagemusha, Ei, took over the role of Electro Archon. Ei, in her pursuit of eternity, created two dolls: one, Scaramouche, was discarded and left to wander until the Fatui found him, the other is the current Shogun who permanently rules over Inazuma, Ei is meditating for all eternity in the "Plane of Euthymia" in the body of the doll. She then tasks the Traveler to uncover evidence that the Fatui was behind the decree, which she then gives to a general named Kujou Sara. Sara attempts to deliver the evidence to the Raiden Shogun, but is knocked out in front of her by Signora. The Traveler confronts and defeats Signora, who is subsequently killed by the Raiden Shogun before she once again challenges the Traveler to a duel in the Plane of Euthymia. Thanks to the interference of Yae Miko and the collective power of the confiscated Visions, the Traveler finally defeats the Raiden Shogun. Yae Miko and Ei reconcile, the Vision Hunt Decree gets repealed, and the war with the Watatsumi Army comes to an end.

Ei begins to reflect on her pursuit of eternity and how it has affected the people of Inazuma, and decides to make changes in how she administers Inazuma. The Shogun, who was designed to abide by the rules of eternity, begins to rebel against Ei and to paralyze her. Ei decides to duel with the Shogun in the Plane of Euthymia, thanks once again to Yae Miko and the Traveler, Ei wins against the Shogun, who concedes and promises to serve Ei as her kagemusha. Ei decides to begin ruling directly over Inazuma once again. The Sakoku Decree is repealed and the borders of Inazuma are open once again. Yae Miko recommends to the Traveler to go next to Sumeru, the nation of Dendro.

Back in Liyue, the Traveler receives a commission from the Adventurer's Guild regarding a concern with the Chasm, Liyue's mines. As the Traveler and Paimon enters the Chasm, they were greeted by the Millelith and let them pass. In the mines, they met Yuehei, the man who posted the commission. Yuehei explains to them that the Liyue Qixing have reopened the Chasm and the miners were finally given permission to work. During their breaks, one of them discovers a group of Hilichurls entering the Chasm and have never returned, prompting concerns among them. The Traveler suspects that the Abyss Order plays a role in the Hilichurls' unusual activity. Entering the underground mines, the Traveler and Paimon discovered some underground ruins resembling the ones in the Defiled Statue. At the same time they went there, they also met Dainsleif, who was surprised for meeting them again as well. As they continue investigating, they soon discovered that the Hilichurls have occupied the underground mines due to the curse's effects lessening in this area. Suddenly, they were attacked by the Shadowy Husks which they easily disposed of. Dainsleif also explains that these knights were formerly members of the Royal Guard that he's also part of. They spotted an another knight from above, which didn't attack them and left. As they defeat more Shadowy Husks, they soon discovered that this phenomenon was not related to the Abyss Order, and the Shadowy Husks were simply guarding the Hilichurls who have awareness of their eventual death. More Shadowy Husks appeared, however the knight they found earlier halted them. Dainsleif then somehow recognizes this knight as Halfdan, one of his former subordinates. The trio continued their journey until they reached the top, where they found a structure which was the source that is abating their curse. Stumbling across a small room occupied by the Hilichurls, they found a flower native to Khaenri'ah known as the "Inteyvat", the Traveler recalls a flashback on the flower about their sibling's plans on removing the curse and rebuild Khaenri'ah.

Vowing to stop the Abyss Order's plans, they were then interrupted by an Abyss Herald, defeating it after a short battle. On their way to the device, they found an Abyss Lector, performing a ritual that activates the structure, which caused the Hilichurls, Dainsleif, and the Shadowy Husks to writhe in pain. The knight named "Halfdan" then sacrificed himself in order to stop the device, albeit temporarily. After destroying the four devices that are powering it, they returned to the lifeless knight's body, confirming its demise. Halfdan's spirit appears before them, Dainsleif reassures to Halfdan that Khaenri'ah shall stand and appreciated his service for their people before his soul fades away. Dainsleif then reminds the Traveler about the Abyss Order's operation which they need to pick a side before departing.
